      "desc:8": "Dyson swarms are an endgame way of producing immense power.\n\nDyson swarms consist of thousands of swarm members encircling the parent star of a system, and energy production from the swarm scales based on the number of members in a swarm. These satellites do not last indefinitely however, they attenuate (decay) over time, with the chance of decay increasing as the number of swarm members increase.\n\nDyson swarm members must be launched into solar orbit via the use of a huge centrifugal launch platform, known as the Spinlauncher. The spinlauncher launches 4 swarm members at a time, consuming a large amount of electricity to do so.\n\nThe Dyson Receiver is the main machine required for collecting energy from the swarm. It collimates the immense energy collected from the swarm into a immensely powerful beam. Setting up requires only a satellite ID chip that is matched to an existing swarm. The energy beam must be pointed towards a Dyson Power Converter.\n\nThe Satellite Dyson Relay can be used to allow Dyson Swarms to provide power during night time.",

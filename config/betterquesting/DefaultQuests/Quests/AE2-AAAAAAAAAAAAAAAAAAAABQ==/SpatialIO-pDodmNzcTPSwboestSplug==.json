      "desc:8": "Spatial IO is a way to cut-and-paste physical volumes of space in your world. It works by swapping the defined volume with an identically-sized volume in the spatial storage dimension, sending whatever\u0027s in the pylon array to the spatial storage dimension, and whatever\u0027s in the dimension to the pylon array.\n\nSpatial IO requires a specific arrangement of its components in order to function, and define the volume to be cut-and-pasted. All of the components must be on the same network in order to function, and you can have only one spatial IO setup on a network. Thus, a subnetwork is recommended.\n\nThe Spatial IO Port controls the spatial IO operation. It shows stats on the multiblock setup, and holds the spatial cells\n\nTo perform a spatial IO operation, place a spatial storage cell in the input slot and give the spatial IO port a redstone pulse. It will then swap the volume in the pylons with the volume in the spatial storage dimension. This means that if you send some set of blocks to the spatial storage dimension, then put another set of blocks in the pylons, put the cell back in the input slot, and trigger the IO port again, the 2nd set of blocks will disappear and the 1st set of blcks will reappear.\n\nAny entity in the defined volume, including you, will be carried along, and if you have no way of getting out, you will be trapped in the spatial storage dimension.\n\nSpatial Pylons are the main part of a spatial IO setup, and define the volume to be affected. The volume is defined by the bounding box of the outside of the pylons, contracted in by 1 block in all directions.",

The files  contain the code for each machine. The code needs to be copy pasted into their individual machine recipe configs located at the HBMrecipes folder.

1) Delete the HBMrecipes folder as to reset everything, that way all the new stuff gets generated.

2) Launch the game to generate the folder again, and then close the game.

3) Remove the _ from the beginning of each file as to have them save the changes.

4) Insert the code from the Custom Recipes folder into the individual files. Make sure to have the correct syntax. Always save after the code has been inserted!

5) Launch the game and hopefully it should work.
